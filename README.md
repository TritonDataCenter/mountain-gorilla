# mountain-gorilla

This repository was part of the Joyent Triton project but has since been
retired. It acted as a "build driver", containing metadata to clone and build
the components of Triton and Manta. It was retired as part of
[an attempt to improve the build.](https://github.com/joyent/rfd/tree/master/rfd/0145)

The repository now contains only this README.md so that links that exist in
other repositories will continue to resolve.
